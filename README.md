# AI-Powered Assistant

***Overview***

An advanced AI-powered assistant leveraging computer vision and speech processing techniques. This assistant integrates various artificial intelligence and machine learning functionalities, including:

• Text-To-Speech (TTS)

• Speech Recognition

• Wake-Up Word Functionality

• Real-time Face Detection

• Face Recognition

• Emotion Analysis


***Features***

• **Real-time Face Detection**: Detects human faces using OpenCV and deep learning models.

• **Face Recognition**: Identifies known individuals using pre-trained models.

• **Emotion Analysis**: Analyzes facial expressions to detect emotions.

• **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text for interaction.

• **Text-To-Speech (TTS)**: Converts text responses into human-like speech.

• **Wake-Up Word**: Listens for a specific word to activate the assistant.


***Technologies Used***

• Python

• OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)

• Dlib (for face recognition)

• TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning-based emotion analysis)

• Google Speech Recognition API (for speech-to-text conversion)

• pyttsx3 (for offline text-to-speech conversion)

• pyaudio (for capturing and processing audio)


***Installation***

• Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KartikBansal2004/AI-Assistant.git
cd AI-Powered-Assistant

• Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

• Run the assistant:

python assistant.py


***Usage***

• Speak the wake-up word to activate the assistant.

• Interact using voice commands.

• The assistant will recognize faces and analyze emotions in real-time.


***Future Enhancements***

• Integration with smart home devices.

• Multilingual support.

• Advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.
